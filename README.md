The main goal of this project is to provide (in Python) a variety of tools to approach some problems related to wave equations (with applications mainly in seismology). The projects is divided into different parts:

- **Introduction** Introduction (Notebook 1 yet to write) about wave equations. Analytic solutions and main mathematical properties.
- **Part_I** Numerical methods to accurately deal with derivatives.
- **Part_II** Simulations of 1D acoustic wave equations
- **Part_III** Simulations of 2D acoustic wave equations
- **Part_IV** Simulations of 1D elastic wave equations
- ...

## Updates
- **Apr. 1, 2022** Project start. 
- **Apr. 5, 2022:** Part 1 of the project is completed except for Notebook 1 we are still writing (it is not unlikely that the first notebook will be the last we will upload ^.^). 
- **Apr. 7, 2022:** Part 2 of the project  is completed.
- **Apr. 12, 2022:** First simulation of Part 3. Uploaded Notebook 7.
- **Apr. 13, 2022:** Discussion of fault zones and earthquakes that happen at depth and related simulations. Uploaded Notebook 8. Part 3 of the project is completed.
- **Apr. 15, 2022:** Review of previous parts and minor corrections. First version of Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3. Note that all the previous versions of the notebook have been delated.
- **Apr. 16, 2022:** 1D elastic wave equation. Discussion of staggered grids. Part 4 of the project is completed.
- **Apr. 20, 2022:** Review of part 4. Discussion of Pseudo-Spectral methods for the acoustic wave equation. Uploaded Notebooks 11 and 12.
- **Apr. 21, 2022:** Pseudo-Spectral methods for 1D elastic wave equations. Uploaded Notebooks 13 and 14. We need to reorganize the folders: Fourier method in Part 1 etc...
- **Apr. 22, 2022:** Complete revision of the previous parts. Minor fixes.
- **Apr. 23, 2022:** Upload of the corrected Notebooks. The numeration of the Notebooks has slightly changed. The first half of the project is now completed (first version).
