The main goal of this project is to provide (in Python) a variety of tools to approach some problems related to wave equations (with applications mainly in seismology). The projects is divided into different parts:
- **Part 1** deals with the *acoustic wave equation in 1D*. In this part we will implement (in Python) reliable *finite difference methods* to simulate the solutions while trying to reduce numerical artifacts.
- **Part 2** working in progress...
- ...

## Updates
- **Apr. 1, 2022** Project start. 
- **Apr. 5, 2022:** Part 1 of the project is completed except for Notebook 1 we are still writing (it is not unlikely that the first notebook will be the last we will upload ^.^). 
- **Apr. 7, 2022:** Part 1 of the project has been inspected and some minor errors have been corrected. Part 1 is composed by Notebooks 1,2,3,4,5,6 and is made available in a single folder (where Notebook 1 is empty because we still have to write it...).
- **Apr. 12, 2022:** First simulation of Part 2. Uploaded Notebook 7.
- **Apr. 13, 2022:** Discussion of fault zones and earthquakes that happen at depth and related simulations. Uploaded Notebook 8.
- **Apr. 15, 2022:** Discussion of the staggered-grid approach and other optimizations. 1D elastic wave equation. Uploaded Notebook 9 and 10.
