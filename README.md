The main goal of this project is to provide (in Python) a variety of tools to approach some problems related to wave equations (with applications mainly in seismology). The projects is divided into different parts:

- **Part_I** Numerical methods to accurately deal with derivatives.
- **Part_II** Simulations of acoustic wave equations
- **Part_III** Simulations of elastic wave equations
